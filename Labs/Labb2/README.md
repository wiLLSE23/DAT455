## Code
The code skeleton was retreived from the course module and then som modules filled in partially or entierly. Only gamemodel.py and graphicsmain.py are changed. The other files are not changed and provided in course.

## Graphics
The graphics.py is retreived from http://mcsp.wartburg.edu/zelle/python and used as a basis for the graphical interface. The file is not changed. 

## Usage
Either run the file graphicsmain.py or the textmain.py. The graphical interface is more fun to play but the text interface is easier to use.
